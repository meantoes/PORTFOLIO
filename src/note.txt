ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
i should've built it responsiveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
now i need to make it over againnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
what should i do?
let's hope for the best, let's grind!!

solution found:
1. i changed all the fixed unit to responsive one (px to rem)
2. i change the px for height and width to vw vh (for glassframe) and % (for divs)
3. made media queries for ipad and mobile using commonly used screen sizes for both device

i also use webp for project iamges instead of jpg or png
