ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
i should've built it responsiveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
now i need to make it over againnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
what should i do?
let's hope for the best, let's grind!!

solution found:
1. i changed all the fixed unit to responsive one (px to rem)
2. i change the px for height and width to vw vh (for glassframe) and % (for divs)
3. made media queries for ipad and mobile using commonly used screen sizes for both device

i also use webp for project iamges instead of jpg or png

im going crazy bro
it's done yesterday but when i asked my brother and my bf to open it, it's just not like i expected
there are some issues like:
    1. the $namefont font isnt loaded
    2. the screensize for my brother laptop doesnt fit. the screen that im using is bigger than him
    so his view is kinda smaller than mine and it makes the website look so much bad
    3. from pov, it's confusing not to have scrollbar. so imma add it
    4.  for the screen view is still tight, like no padding for the body

i just felt like im dumb. like i cant even make it right. now i just think that i need to learn lots of things
there are lots to be discovered along the way so let's go. still im feeling low haha.

OH. DONT FORGET ABOUT THE ROUTING ISSUE WHEN I TRIED TO DEPLOY IT HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH.
bye github. or bye najwa? hahahaahhaahahahaha :') i asked gpt and now it works. now i know a new way to deploy hahahaahhaahahahaha
the thing is there was no problem when i deployed on vercel.app but when i tried to deploy the website to github or netlify, they just wouldnt load. so yea

these are what i learned:
- Added basename="/PORTFOLIO" in <BrowserRouter> >> <BrowserRouter basename="/PORTFOLIO"> on main.jsx btw
- Set base: '/PORTFOLIO/' in vite.config.js
- Made sure index.html â†’ 404.html is copied for React Router >> Copy-Item -Path .\dist\index.html -Destination .\dist\404.html -Force
- Deployed with gh-pages (no need to commit before running npm run deploy, but for best practice yeah)
- added some packages to json. (for gh-pages)

this was my first time deploy a react project btw

NOW at 3.54 am
i tried to fix the font issue. the problem was i didnt make / define them in a font file
so that the font can load first before the scss.
and what i learned from this was
- to define the fonts when we build a project and
- that woff2 is the best format for web

8pm the next day.
- font issue solved (path was wrong fonts intead of Fonts bye) (be careful while using advanced option on firefox fonts settings cause it disabled all fonts on the website (all) and only use their default fonts)
- ok next time let's define the fonts variables (from the design system) in one place so if i wanna change the value of each properties it would be easier for me.
- font size issue fixed.
- now icon. done using clamp hehe
- im still not sure about the scrollbar, it's not yet perfect but that's it for tonight ig (1.39am 9/23/2025)

11.50pm (23/09)
- gonna add back button for every pages that need it. 
- remove scrollbar in mobile view > done
- BRO I DIDNT KNOW, i have function ProjectModal which content the modal divs and inline modal on jsx file. i thought they work together but turns out im just writing it twice. thanks gpt for give me some lights for the truth hahahaahhaahahahaha
brb i have a class in the morning (1.39am 09/24)
