                            Hi, my name is Najwa Hanana, and I am from South Tangerang City. I am currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Information Systems at Hasanuddin University (Unhas). Since high school, I have been curious about creating and building things, which has grown into a strong interest in programming and design.
                            <br /><br />Through my involvement in various organizations, I have gained valuable experience in graphic design, photography, and journalism. I enjoy learning new things, adapting to different environments, and continuously improving my skills.
                            <br /><br />I see myself as a fast learner who is always eager to take on challenges and grow both personally and professionally.
